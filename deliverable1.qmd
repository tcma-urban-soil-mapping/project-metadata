# Metadata for Deliverable 1: Updated Urban Soil Survey for Minneapolis/St. Paul/Bloomington MSA & DSP Investigation

## Approach

We are completing soil profile descriptions during the field seasons of 2024, 2025, and 2026 across the Twin Cities metro to produce an updated survey.

If you live in the Metro and are willing to let us visit your property, please fill out this Google Form: [Residential Site Interest Form](https://forms.gle/zgRBZLXrzCVcu9Cv6).
