## Minutes

### 1. Update on finding surficial geology maps

-   Nora checked the teaching lab for a copy of soil maps and county atlases but did not find any.
-   She plans to ask Nic about obtaining a hard copy. If not available, she can purchase one.

### 2. Update on clipping generalized land use data

-   Nora trimmed the generalized land use 2020 data set to the tiger data for the urban area cluster.
-   She encountered errors with geometry while clipping the data set and had to fix it to make a new layer.
-   However, she is now unable to get the symbology to show correctly, and the attribute table is empty.
-   Nora is unsure how to clip out specific areas like lakes and islands from the data set.

### 3. Discussion on mapping challenges

-   Patty shared her screen and showed the generalized land use data she had symbolized for 2020.
-   Patty explained how she colored different land uses (e.g., agricultural, residential, industrial) for easier visualization.
-   Patty also showed a layer she created by clipping the soil survey polygon layer to the 7-county metro area.
-   She joined this layer with NASIS data and created a new column for "percent no data" to identify areas with missing soil horizon data.
-   The duo discussed the challenges of mapping urban areas, floodplains, and undeveloped lands.
-   They identified the need to consult with Nic on the next steps and potentially expand the project boundary.

### 4. Potential dates for project kickoff meeting

-   Joe suggested targeting the last week of May or the first week of June for the project kickoff meeting.
-   Nic will identify 2-3 days during that period when he can fly in the partners.
-   Nora will follow up with Nik this week to finalize the dates and get them on everyone's calendar before the field season starts.

### Other Notes

-   Nora will be out of town on March 13th, 14th and 15th and unavailable for the regular meeting.
-   The meeting for the following week was rescheduled to Tuesday, March 19th at 2:30 PM.
