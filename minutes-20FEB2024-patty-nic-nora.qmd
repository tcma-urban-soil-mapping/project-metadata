# Patty, Nic, and Nora Check-In 20FEB2024

## Attendees

- Nic Jelinski, University of Minnesota
- Nora Pearson, University of Minnesota 
- Patty Burns, NRCS

## Project Overview

- This project involves updating SSURGO soil survey data for the Twin Cities metro area.

- There is a high demand for updated urban soil information. Much of the existing SSURGO data for the core urban areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul is very limited. 

- The project will involve field sampling, lab analysis, digital soil mapping, and development of products tailored for urban end users.

- The project timeline is 2023-2025.

- A key early task is defining the project area boundary - the "contiguous census qualifying urbanized area within the Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Bloomington Metropolitan Statistical Area". 

- Nora is working on analyzing land use, land cover, census, and other data layers to delineate this project area.

- The project area will likely encompass Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the inner ring suburbs. It will be smaller than the full 7-county metro area.

- Defining the project area boundary will allow intersecting it with the existing SSURGO map units to identify the project map units.

## Project Components

### Soil Survey Update

- The main project component is conducting field sampling and analysis to update and improve the SSURGO soil map and data for the defined urbanized project area.

- The team will start by securing access permissions for public parks, open spaces, etc. This will give initial sites to sample while permissions for other areas are sought.

- Field work will involve morphological descriptions and sampling by genetic horizon. Samples will be archived and analyzed.

- Mid-infrared spectroscopy will be used to predict soil properties. Lab data will verify and calibrate predictions.

- Rasters, not vectors, will be the main mapping products. Rasters integrate well with the high-resolution LiDAR, land cover, and other metro geospatial data.

- The NRCS will handle ingesting final raster products into their systems and creating certified SSURGO updates.

### Dynamic Soil Properties (DSP) 

- A DSP investigation will occur in 2024-2025 at selected urban land use sites.

- The DSP investigation will be "extensive" level - less intensive than a full DSM project.

- The focus will likely be on variations across urban land uses, especially urban agriculture.

- 2023 will involve planning and selecting sites for the eventual DSP component.

### Mapping Guide

- A documented mapping guide will be developed on conducting urban digital soil mapping and surveys. 

- It will build off an existing 2023 Urban Soil Survey Mapping Guide (NRCS Urban Focus Team 2023).

### Outreach

- Community engagement such as on-site soil screening will be conducted. 

- NRCS staff will be invited to outreach events.

### Geophysical Tools

- Training will be provided to NRCS on using field portable X-ray fluorescence for contaminant screening.

- This will tie into the NRCS's Site Assessment [CEMA 207](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/FY23_CEMA%20207_Site%20Assessment%20and%20Soil%20Testing%20for%20Contaminants%20Activity.pdf) protocol.

## Project Timeline and Milestones

### 2024

- Kickoff meeting with NRCS partners in mid-December 2023.

- Broader project kickoff meeting in May 2024 with other potential project data users.

- Finalize sampling plans.

- Field work in summer 2024.

- Plan DSP investigation sites.

### 2025 

- Continue field work.

- Perform DSP investigation.

### 2025

- Final data analysis and product development.

- Deliver certified SSURGO updates and final reports.

## Next Steps

- Refine project area boundary using various data layers.

- By next meeting (3/28/23): Have draft boundary ready to discuss.

## Action Items

- Nora: Have project area boundary draft ready for 3/28 meeting.

- Nic: Schedule May kickoff meeting. 

- Patty: Check on getting urban areas shapefile from Census (during meeting with Danielle).

- Nic: Send Patty and Nora example mapping guide.

## Discussion Points

- Good foundational data exists - land cover, Lidar, geology maps, etc. This will help stratify sampling and support modeling.

- Existing twin cities soil survey isn't terrible compared to other cities. Useful concepts are present to build from. 

- Permissions and access are critical in urban areas. Starting with public lands then expanding outward is a solid approach.

- NRCS will handle integrating final products into their systems and protocols. The research team will focus on developing the core raster mapping products.

- NRCS staff may participate in field work as available. Field calibration will be done in June/July 2023 with all teams present.

- Joe Brennan (NRCS) will help with DSP methodology. Patty has DSP experience from other projects.

## Follow Up

- Shift upcoming Tuesday meetings to Wednesday at 2PM.

- Share contact info for coordinating outside of meetings.

- Next meeting is 3/28/23 at 2pm via Zoom.
