## Project Overview

-   This project involves updating SSURGO soil survey data for the Twin Cities metro area.

-   There is a high demand for updated urban soil information. Much of the existing SSURGO data for the core urban areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul is very limited.

-   The project will involve field sampling, lab analysis, digital soil mapping, and development of products tailored for urban end users.

-   The project timeline is 2023-2025.

-   A key early task is defining the project area boundary - the "contiguous census qualifying urbanized area within the Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Bloomington Metropolitan Statistical Area".

-   Nora is working on analyzing land use, land cover, census, and other data layers to delineate this project area.

-   The project area will likely encompass Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the inner ring suburbs. It will be smaller than the full 7-county metro area.

-   Defining the project area boundary will allow intersecting it with the existing SSURGO map units to identify the project map units.

## Project Components

### Soil Survey Update

-   The main project component is conducting field sampling and analysis to update and improve the SSURGO soil map and data for the defined urbanized project area.

-   The team will start by securing access permissions for public parks, open spaces, etc. This will give initial sites to sample while permissions for other areas are sought.

-   Field work will involve morphological descriptions and sampling by genetic horizon. Samples will be archived and analyzed.

-   Mid-infrared spectroscopy will be used to predict soil properties. Lab data will verify and calibrate predictions.

-   Rasters, not vectors, will be the main mapping products. Rasters integrate well with the high-resolution LiDAR, land cover, and other metro geospatial data.

-   The NRCS will handle ingesting final raster products into their systems and creating certified SSURGO updates.

### Dynamic Soil Properties (DSP)

-   A DSP investigation will occur in 2024-2025 at selected urban land use sites.

-   The DSP investigation will be "extensive" level - less intensive than a full DSM project.

-   The focus will likely be on variations across urban land uses, especially urban agriculture.

-   2023 will involve planning and selecting sites for the eventual DSP component.

### Mapping Guide

-   A documented mapping guide will be developed on conducting urban digital soil mapping and surveys.

-   It will build off an existing 2023 Urban Soil Survey Mapping Guide (NRCS Urban Focus Team 2023).

### Outreach

-   Community engagement such as on-site soil screening will be conducted.

-   NRCS staff will be invited to outreach events.

### Geophysical Tools

-   Training will be provided to NRCS on using field portable X-ray fluorescence for contaminant screening.

-   This will tie into the NRCS's Site Assessment [CEMA 207](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/FY23_CEMA%20207_Site%20Assessment%20and%20Soil%20Testing%20for%20Contaminants%20Activity.pdf) protocol.

## Project Timeline and Milestones

### 2024

-   Kickoff meeting with NRCS partners in mid-December 2023.

-   Broader project kickoff meeting in May 2024 with other potential project data users.

-   Finalize sampling plans.

-   Field work in summer 2024.

-   Plan DSP investigation sites.

### 2025

-   Continue field work.

-   Perform DSP investigation.

### 2025

-   Final data analysis and product development.

-   Deliver certified SSURGO updates and final reports.

## Next Steps

-   Refine project area boundary using various data layers.

-   By next meeting (3/28/23): Have draft boundary ready to discuss.

## Action Items

-   Nora: Have project area boundary draft ready for 3/28 meeting.

-   Nic: Schedule May kickoff meeting.

-   Patty: Check on getting urban areas shapefile from Census (during meeting with Danielle).

-   Nic: Send Patty and Nora example mapping guide.

## Discussion Points

-   Good foundational data exists - land cover, Lidar, geology maps, etc. This will help stratify sampling and support modeling.

-   Existing twin cities soil survey isn't terrible compared to other cities. Useful concepts are present to build from.

-   Permissions and access are critical in urban areas. Starting with public lands then expanding outward is a solid approach.

-   NRCS will handle integrating final products into their systems and protocols. The research team will focus on developing the core raster mapping products.

-   NRCS staff may participate in field work as available. Field calibration will be done in June/July 2023 with all teams present.

-   Joe Brennan (NRCS) will help with DSP methodology. Patty has DSP experience from other projects.

## Follow Up

-   Shift upcoming Tuesday meetings to Wednesday at 2PM.

-   Share contact info for coordinating outside of meetings.

-   Next meeting is 3/28/23 at 2pm via Zoom.
