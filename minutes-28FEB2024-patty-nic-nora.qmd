## Agenda Items

### Update on Data Preparation

- Nora shared her screen in QGIS to show the census urban area clusters data for the US reprojected into UTM zone 15N. She needs to clip this to just Minnesota. 

- The group looked at the generalized land use data. Nora extracted just the "developed" land use categories. This includes residential, commercial, industrial, etc. 

- Patty had already clipped the TIGER census boundaries to a 7 or 10 county metro area. There is good alignment between the TIGER developed areas and the generalized land use developed areas. 

- The group discussed using the TIGER boundaries as a starting point to define the project area. They will remove the Stillwater area in Washington County and cut out Anoka County chunks that stretch beyond the core metro.

### Ideas for Defining Project Area

- Patty will pull SSURGO soil maps for the 7 county metro area and make a layer showing percent of map units that have "urban" in the component name. This will help identify the core urban areas.

- She will also pull out Udorthents, as these are commonly used for urban soils but have no data. 

- Nic suggested also extracting floodplain components, gravel pits, and other "trash can" units that are opportunities for updating.

- Nora asked whether well-mapped outer areas should still be updated. Nic said this could add value by updating soil data, but they will focus on the core urban area first.

- The group looked at historical land use maps from 1945, 1984, and 2020. There has been a lot of development in the southern part of the metro. Nic noted the survey year ranges will influence what gets updated.

### Planning for Kickoff Meeting

- Patty relayed that the NRCS office needs a UMN presenter for the April 2 Fargo meeting. Nic will coordinate with Brent to determine who will present.

- Possible kickoff meeting dates are the week of May 6th or the last week of May. Patty will provide a few options from the NRCS side.

### Action Items
- Nora will trim the urban area shapefile to the core metro area.

- Patty will create SSURGO map unit layers focused on urban, Udorthents, floodplain components, gravel pits, etc.

- Nic will follow up on UMN presenter for Fargo kickoff meeting. 

- Patty will provide date options for kickoff meeting.

## Additional Discussion

- Patty showed Nora the clipped TIGER census layer she already created. She will send this to Nora as a starting point.

- Nora said the city labels layer would help orient herself. Patty can provide common reference layers.

- Patty's role is Soil Specialist, NRCS Contractor. Nora will update the e-book.

- Best days to reach Patty are Tues-Fri. Text is also good for quick questions.

- Patty requested county geologic atlases if UMN has hard copies to review. Nora will check and order if needed.

## Action Items Moving Forward

- Nora will continue preparing the project area shapefile.

- Patty will compile SSURGO layers focused on urban soils.

- The team will make final decisions on project area after reviewing additional layers.

- Nic and Patty will coordinate scheduling the kickoff meeting for May or June.

- Nora and Patty will arrange county atlases for Patty's reference.

- The team will reconvene next Wednesday for continued discussion.
