    "text": "Project Description\nThe purpose of this agreement, between the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and University of Minnesota (Recipient), is to harness existing collective resources, including non-NRCS research, data, specific expertise, and analytical capacity of soils in urban environments to complete a soil survey update. With much of the US population living in Urbanized Areas (UAs), there is a need for improved understanding of soil suitability’s, and limitations in these environments. Soil characterization information is needed in these areas as the resources are intensively managed, while current legacy soil survey products are largely out-of-date and provide limited use. Additionally, this agreement will promote the understanding the dynamic nature of soil properties in urban environments and expanding the use of new tools in support of urban agriculture.",

    "section": "5.3 Data Storage and Preservation",
    "text": "5.3 Data Storage and Preservation\nData generated by activities outlined in this proposal will be initially stored and maintained in the GEMS platform hosted in the data center of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI). MSI performs full off-site backups as part of their disaster recovery plan. GEMS has recurrent Minnesota State Government funding to maintain its core operations, currently with no expiry date. All registered data in GEMS is persistent, given a DataCite DOI minted by our University of Minnesota Libraries partners. In addition to storage in GEMS and linkage in metadata to original data sources whenever possible, harmonized data will be imported into NASIS in compatible, machine- readable format and therefore all data produced by the project will also be imported into NASIS prior to project end. Per the project narrative, the power of the GEMS platform is that datasets are input “as is”, maintaining the data structure of the original authors. GEMS metadata for each dataset includes full reference information. If the dataset is publicly available, the GEMS metadata for that dataset will include information on dataset access, storage platform, and author contact information. This metadata is in JSON format and can be reconfigured and exported for any metadata catalog (in this case specifically targeting the NOTCOM catalog maintained by the NRCS Initial Mapping Team) that may be maintained by NRCS. The GEMS platform excels at utilizing field metadata and fuzzy matching to enable post-input data harmonization. During the dataset input process, in addition to constructing dataset metadata, metadata tags are assigned to each dataset field from a dynamic data dictionary which can be expanded as necessary as more datasets are added. These field metadata tags then become the primary vehicle through which scripts are written to subsequently harmonize the data for export and usage in DSM. There are many advantages to this approach. The primary advantage is that datasets are imported “as is”, meaning that data will match the original data source and author format. This increases transparency because there is no prior “re-working” of data before it is added to the database. As scripts are written to harmonize datasets to a defined format using field metadata tags, these scripts will also be available on GitHub to enable any potential user to recreate the eventual harmonized dataset that is utilized for DSM. Finally, because scripting is used for harmonization, output format is flexible. This is critical, because scripts will be developed to harmonize data and output in a format which can be ingested into NASIS.\n\n5.3.1 Data Sharing, Protection and Public Access\nThe GEMS agroinformatics platform developed by the University of Minnesota supports the data interoperability and sharing needs of this project. GEMS adheres to and, via its extensive (and still expanding) data handling toolkit, makes practically possible, FAIR(ER) data sharing principles; findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, ethical—i.e., respects data sensitivities (e.g., partner sourced) or any proprietary (e.g., privately-sourced) data—and reproducible. Non-private data will be made open to the public via GEMS-Open, an open database of functionally interoperable and documented data that adheres to standard and harmonized meta-data protocols. When viewing and analyzing datasets, GEMS requires users to click licenses of each primary data source prior to receiving access to the data. Similarly, all data product derivatives are electronically tagged with links to the product sources in their metadata, ensuring proper credit attributions, as often described by their license agreements. The ASDB will adopt a data policy that accounts for data ownership, allows reuse of data and creation of data derivatives (e.g., pooling of soil data into new larger continental soil applications). We will adopt the Creative Commons Licensing scheme for data sharing and attributions. Importantly, the spectrum of private-public data sharing is accounted for in the ASDB. This is an important aspect because some soil data have inherent restrictions of data usage (e.g., soil projects funded by private companies or corporations, soil data with privacy/confidentiality protection), while other soil projects funded by federal resources are considered public goods without data restrictions. Geographic coordinates are in some cases private data that need to be protected for confidentiality reasons and may be released only for public use in aggregated/masked format.",

GEMS also has policies reviewed by MSI’s Research Security and Compliance Analyst. All GEMS staff with access to private data sign an internal non-disclosure agreement designed by UMN’s Office of the General Counsel. All operations within the platform are isolated into encrypted containers where no other users have access (hence no snooping). Data entering or leaving these containers is also encrypted to prevent opportunity for leaks. All identifiable data residing in the platform are legally deemed private and non-public by the State of Minnesota, and hence not FOIAble. Finally, we provide users with various anonymization tools to de-identify their own data sets prior to sharing. These include removal of named identifiers, fuzzing and jittering of geo-coordinates and geospatial aggregation.\n\n5.4.1 Roles and Responsibilities\nPI Jelinski will be responsible ensuring the data management plan is followed by all project participants and will also be responsible for reporting compliance with this data management plan to NRCS. The annual and final reports to NRCS will have an expanded data management plan as an integral component, and will include progress in data sharing (e.g., statistics on shared and accessed data sets, publications, DOIs, outreach materials). The final report will describe the data that was produced during the award period and the components that will be stored and preserved (including the expected duration) after the award ends. The GEMS platform data steward will ensure that the data management plan will be compliant with the Research Terms and Conditions that govern NRCS-funded projects.",

    "text": "8.4 Summary of Discussion\n\n8.4.1 Overview of DSP Guidelines\n\nNRCS is currently updating the DSP guide, expected to be published this year. The draft can be shared once it goes through public review in 4 months.\nGoal of a DSP project is to get DSP data on as much area as possible, focusing on the most extensive or important soils.\nRecommend 3 plots per condition (similar ecology/land management). Each plot has a main pedon and 2 satellites.\nFor intensive projects, use KSSL methods so data is comparable.\nIntensive projects require KSSL analysis. Intermediate projects use in-house lab. This project would likely be intensive given the UMN lab capacity.\n\n\n\n8.4.2 LA DSP Project Overview\n\nLooked at natural ground cover, artificial ground cover, and traditional lawns. Interested in climate resiliency, carbon storage, and gas fluxes.\nFocused on urban climate and social health. Examined techniques like xeroscaping.\nPartnered with Tree People organization to provide outreach on beneficial landscaping based on DSP data.\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Site Access Challenges and Solutions\n\nAccess can be a challenge. Partnering with local organizations that can help arrange access to sites is recommended.\nCan dig pits once to collect samples. Don’t need long-term access.\nRecommend taking photos, cores, and bulk samples if possible since access is limited.\n\n\n\n8.4.4 Study Design Discussion\n\nMost plots should be spread across the urban area, not concentrated on one site.\nFor urban agriculture focus, residential lawns could be reference state since that is common land use. Hoop houses and in-ground plots would be altered states.\n\nIf including non-urban reference site, look at uncultivated native sites outside urban area.\nDesign depends on goals - compare urban soils only or also compare to non-urban.\nNRCS flexible on study design within urban focus. Recommend consulting urban conservationists like Matt Lundberg.\n\n\n\n8.4.5 Analysis Methods\n\nRequired intensive tier uses KSSL methods. Can send samples to KSSL but may take 1-2 years to get data back.\nOptional intensive tier analyses like POXC could be done in UMN lab.\nInterest in testing additional indicators relevant to urban soils like contaminants.\nIf additional lab costs needed can discuss modifications to support more analyses.\n\n\n\n8.4.6 Related Research Opportunities\n\nIf other non-urban research needs identified later, NRCS may be able to do supplemental sampling through MLRA offices. Would share data to support publications.\nAllows sampling interesting uses like railyards if identified later.\nNeed to avoid overlap with this urban ag focus agreement.",

The group discussed balancing NRCS requirements for update surveys with the practical limitations of working in an urban environment. They talked through issues like site access, using non-traditional covariates for digital soil mapping, and the timeline for completing field work over two seasons. Action items included compiling sample density statistics from other urban surveys, continuing permit acquisition, and organizing an initial project kickoff meeting in March 2024. The next meeting will focus on the sampling plan with a smaller work group before bringing together all project partners.",

    "section": "10.3 Key Training Topics Covered",
    "text": "10.3 Key Training Topics Covered\n\n10.3.1 1. Urban Soil Forming Factors\nRandy presented the concept of six soil forming factors in urban environments, with humans as the sixth “master variable” that can: - Reset the clock on soil formation - Modify or change other soil forming factors - Impact parent material, climate, organisms, and topography - Reshape landforms through construction and development\nDevelopment history, zoning practices, construction methods, and material era all influence urban soil properties. Examples included coal combustion byproducts in filled marshland (Ithaca, NY) and extensive hillside reshaping in Los Angeles County.\n\n\n10.3.2 2. Characteristics of Urban Soils\nKey properties observed in urban soils include: - Heterogeneous or homogenized properties with abrupt changes in color and texture - Higher bulk density and compaction (though this may decrease over time as roots develop) - Rapid pedogenesis even in short timeframes after site establishment - Human artifacts including construction debris, plastic materials, and other manufactured items - Elevated rock fragment content from construction practices - Higher pH values typically from concrete dust and calcium inputs - Higher organic carbon content in surface horizons due to intensive management\n\n\n10.3.3 3. Human Transported vs. Human Altered Materials\nHuman Transported Materials (HTM): - Soil moved outside of the one cubic meter pedon unit - Requires corresponding anthropogenic landform - Most common type found in urban areas - Classified as parent material in soil taxonomy\nHuman Altered Materials: - In-situ alteration (e.g., deep ripping, subsoiling) - Less common in urban mapping - Examples include breaking up restrictive layers in agricultural soils\n\n\n10.3.4 4. Anthropogenic Landforms\nThree categories of anthropogenic geomorphic features: - Anthroscapes - Landscape level - Anthropogenic landforms - Comparable to regular landform level - Constructional (built up) - Destructional (excavated/cut) - Anthropogenic microfeatures - Smaller features within broader landforms\nImportant: Always identify both native landscape/landform AND anthropogenic landform when HTM is present.\n\n\n10.3.5 5. Human Artifacts Classification\nDefinition: Materials created, modified, or transported by humans for practical purposes\nSize Classes: - Discrete artifacts - Greater than 2mm - Particulate artifacts - Less than 2mm (captured in mineralogy)\nCritical Properties: - Must be both cohesive and persistent to be included in texture modifiers - Non-persistent materials (e.g., cardboard) are not counted in texture analysis\nCommon Types: - Construction debris (concrete, brick, asphalt, ceramics, metal, glass) - Mechanically fractured rocks intentionally placed (aggregate, gravel, road base) - Coal combustion and industrial byproducts\n\n\n10.3.6 6. Artifactual Texture Modifiers\n\nUse same percentage breaks as traditional modifiers: 15%, 35%, 60%\nOnly cohesive and persistent artifacts are considered\nDual rock fragment-artifact modifiers most common\nFragment name goes first with hyphen, then artifactual modifier\nExample: “very cobbly-artifactual loamy sand”\n\n\n\n10.3.7 7. Horizon Designations for HTM\nKey Principles: - Based on pedogenic development since material placement - Inherited properties are considered geogenic unless formed in place - Use caret symbol (^) for every horizon formed in HTM (e.g., ^A, ^Bw, ^Cu)\nCommon Suffixes: - u suffix - Presence of human artifacts (no depth or number threshold) - b suffix - Buried genetic horizons (not buried soils) - d suffix - Densic/anthrodensic materials (mechanically compacted dense layers)",

    "text": "10.4 Major Discussion Points and Clarifications\n\n10.4.1 Mollisol vs. Alfisol Classification\nThe team discussed challenges in differentiating between mollic and ochric epipedons in urban soils. Key considerations: - Base saturation typically high (&gt;50%) in urban areas due to concrete dust and calcium inputs - Average pH in Twin Cities area around 7.4 (based on Jelinski lab INFEWS work) - Team should assume high base saturation for classification purposes pending lab data\n\n\n10.4.2 A Horizon vs. C Horizon Designation\nExtensive discussion on when to call transported dark material an A horizon versus C horizon: - Must have pedogenic development (structure formation, organic accumulation) since site establishment - Dark color alone from transported topsoil doesn’t qualify as A horizon - Time zero resets when materials are moved - Structure development and root penetration are key indicators - Judgment call based on field observations of pedogenic processes\n\n\n10.4.3 Cambic (Bw) Horizon Development\nTeam has been conservative about calling ^Bw horizons: - Should lean toward ^C designation unless strong justification exists - More likely in upper 20-30 cm directly below A horizon - Deeper occurrences (&gt;50 cm) questionable for pedogenic development - Look for associated features (clay films, etc.) that indicate in-situ formation - ^A over ^C sequence is very common and typical\n\n\n10.4.4 Buried Soils Rules\nComplex taxonomy rules for classification when surface mantles of HTM overlie buried genetic horizons:\nSurface Mantle Requirements: - Can have epiped on and cambic horizon, but no other diagnostic subsurface horizons - Must have ≥7.5 cm in lower part failing all diagnostic requirements - No thickness requirements for surface mantles\nClassification Surface: - If surface mantle &lt;50 cm and no buried soil: use top of original surface - If surface mantle ≥50 cm and no buried genetic horizons: classify whole profile - If buried soil present: use current surface, only surface mantle properties for classification - Exceptions: family criteria, soil temperature, and moisture use current surface",

    "text": "10.9 Key Takeaways\nThe meeting emphasized that soil mapping focuses on properties and behavior rather than strict taxonomic classification. The team should: - Maintain consistency in field descriptions and concept application - Document comprehensive field observations with explanatory notes - Focus on interpretive value and soil behavior for grouping decisions - Accept that some variability in classification will exist within concept groups - Remember that representative sites will define final database classifications\nThe urban environment creates inherent “noise” in the dataset, making consistent application of concepts more important than perfect taxonomic precision. The upcoming field visit will provide crucial hands-on correlation experience as the project moves toward map unit development.",

If buried, they should be marked. As a best practice, find the electrical pole and the location that the pole connects to the house.\nAvoid sampling within three feet of a sidewalk, as utilities are commonly buried parallel to them.\nCheck for detached buildings (garages, etc.) and look for signs of buried electrical lines from the house to the building. If there is a buried line, conduit will be visible coming from the ground and entering the detached building.\nThe sampling location should be a representative area of the site and not highly disturbed in comparison to natural conditions. Keep in mind that this soil survey update is on a broader scale than the home level.\nIn residential areas, do not sample in food-producing areas. Compost and other amendment applications are common and this does not represent the most common land use.\n\nIf sampling at a construction site: once location is established; place cones around the work area. Hard hats and high vis vests should be worn.",

The tendency can be to expand the soil in the gutter. Compare the hole depth to the gutter depth after every 2 buckets by putting the auger all the way into the hole, putting a fist around the auger pole (with the bottom of the fist marking the ground depth), and comparing the length of the auger that was in the ground to the length of soil laying in the gutter.\n\nTake detailed photos and videos of the profile in the gutter. This should be done prior to describing the profile to minimize disturbance. Use the spray bottle to re-moisten the profile if necessary.\n\nLay a tape measure showing centimeters on one side of the gutter and a black fabric tape measure (“photo tape”) on the other side.\nPhotos: Stand at the bottom of the gutter, hold the phone directly over the gutter (parallel to the gutter, not angled), and take a vertical photo of the entire profile. Also take vertical photos of 20 cm sections of the profile.\nVideo: take a horizontal video while slowly moving from the top to the bottom of the profile.",

See page 3-1 in the red book for complete lists for each.\n\nCollect a soil sample from each horizon in a 5x8” ULINE bag labeled with sample code.\nCollect approximately 1 cup of soil, if possible; this should be just above the bottom line of the white box on the ULINE bags.",

Many of ours are either glacial or fluvial.\n\nIf we didn’t identify Landscape/Landform, feel free to make an educated guess based on the site location (find the location in SoilExplorer). Chapter 3 of the Field Book for Describing Soils has a long and nicely organized list of possible options starting on page 3-10 or page 174 of the PDF.\nIf you aren’t at all sure what to choose, note that on the notes document and submit the survey without it – Nora will populate it.\n\nAnthro: use your judgement here. Options I’ve chosen are fill, anthroscape, and artificial levee. NRCS is still thinking about what anthroscape means. If a site has any HTM at all, if should have an anthropogenic landform marked.\n\nElevation, aspect: leave blank.\nSlope: populate from sheet.

Method should be pit, small. The remaining ones should be auger, dutch.\nEnter Top/Bottom depth and Horizon Designation from sheet.\nName: entered from sheet. Reminder to make sure horizons with artifacts get “u” suffixes and the horizons under HTM/fill get a “2” in front for a lithologic discontinuity.\nBoundary Distinctness and Topography: leave blank. We didn’t describe this in augered profiles. If there was a small pit dug and we described distinctness, please mark it.\nMatrix color: enter as described.\n\nNote: there is no place to enter percentages of different colors, so that should be entered in the horizon notes text box at the bottom of the page. Use the following format: “80% 10YR 2/1 20% 10YR 4/4.”\nNote: at the bottom of the Matrix Color box, there’s a bar that says “1 of 5” - click the arrow to the right to enter multiple colors.\n\nTexture: mark no for Stratified Flag unless we wrote that in. Leave In Lieu Texture blank; I don’t think we ever used it. Add a Textural Modifier if we marked one – most commonly, we used gravelly (GR) or extremely gravelly (EXGR).\n\nNote page 2-42 of the Field Book (page 86): if there are ≥ 15% artifacts, the horizon gets a textural modifier.\n\nRock Frags: enter % and Sz High – if we only wrote one number for the size, it was the largest piece. We didn’t note Hardness, Round, Shape, or Kind, so leave those blank.\nStructure: use page 2-52 of the Field Book (page 96 of the PDF) for descriptions of what each item means. Leave ID and Parting To blank.

We didn’t describe Hardness, Shape, Location, or Redox Bnd, so leave those blank. See page 1-27 of the Field Book (page 39) for a list of what each abbreviation means. We used moist colors.\n\nUPDATE 29JAN: all FMCs (iron concretions) we entered, should be entered as F3M (non-cemented masses of Fe3+). Masses are much more common than concretions; we just used the wrong symbol.\n\nConcentrations: same notes as redox box. See pages 2-26 and 2-27 of the Field Book (pages 70-71) for a list of what each abbreviation means.\nPed and Void Surface Features: used infrequently, but enter as described or leave blank if nothing.\nRoots: we described percentage of roots for most of the season, instead of number, like NASIS wants, so leave Roots blank if there is a percent on our sheet. If there is a percent, enter “1% roots” in the notes box.\nPores: didn’t use often.\nField Measurement Properties: enter effervescence and clay/sand %s here. See page 2-87 of the Field Book (page 131) for a list of what each effervescence abbreviation means. We used HCL, 1N. Leave clay and sand estimates blank if we didn’t mark anything. Silt estimate is calculated automatically.\n\nUPDATE 29JAN: if we didn’t estimate sand/clay, delete the zero that is automatically populated in the silt text box.\n\nHuman artifacts: this would be on the third page of the scanned PDF. Enter as described. Choose the Kind that most closely matches what we wrote. If none match at all, leave it blank and enter the kind into the notes box of the artifacts box. See page 2-50 of the Field book (page 94) for a list of what each abbreviation means. Artifact-related notes should go in the “NOTES” textbox.\n\nUPDATE 29JAN: reminder that any horizon that has artifacts should get a “u” suffix in the horizon name. We missed this frequently, especially on the earlier pedons.\n\nHorizon NOTES: check the MISCELLANEOUS FIELD NOTES box on the front page of the sheet for any notes we made about individual horizons and enter them in the Horizon NOTES box. Do not enter site-level notes here.\n\nRepeat for each horizon, up to 10. If more than 10 horizons were described, consider stratifying them (combining) if they are small and similar.
