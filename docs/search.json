    "text": "Project Description\n[From Project Proposal] The purpose of this agreement, between the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and University of Minnesota (Recipient), is to harness existing collective resources, including non-NRCS research, data, specific expertise, and analytical capacity of soils in urban environments to complete a soil survey update. With much of the US population living in Urbanized Areas (UAs), there is a need for improved understanding of soil suitability’s, and limitations in these environments. Soil characterization information is needed in these areas as the resources are intensively managed, while current legacy soil survey products are largely out-of-date and provide limited use. Additionally, this agreement will promote the understanding the dynamic nature of soil properties in urban environments and expanding the use of new tools in support of urban agriculture."

    "section": "5.3 Data Storage and Preservation",
    "text": "5.3 Data Storage and Preservation\nData generated by activities outlined in this proposal will be initially stored and maintained in the GEMS platform hosted in the data center of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI). MSI performs full off-site backups as part of their disaster recovery plan. GEMS has recurrent Minnesota State Government funding to maintain its core operations, currently with no expiry date. All registered data in GEMS is persistent, given a DataCite DOI minted by our University of Minnesota Libraries partners. In addition to storage in GEMS and linkage in metadata to original data sources whenever possible, harmonized data will be imported into NASIS in compatible, machine- readable format and therefore all data produced by the project will also be imported into NASIS prior to project end. Per the project narrative, the power of the GEMS platform is that datasets are input “as is”, maintaining the data structure of the original authors. GEMS metadata for each dataset includes full reference information. If the dataset is publicly available, the GEMS metadata for that dataset will include information on dataset access, storage platform, and author contact information. This metadata is in JSON format and can be reconfigured and exported for any metadata catalog (in this case specifically targeting the NOTCOM catalog maintained by the NRCS Initial Mapping Team) that may be maintained by NRCS. The GEMS platform excels at utilizing field metadata and fuzzy matching to enable post-input data harmonization. During the dataset input process, in addition to constructing dataset metadata, metadata tags are assigned to each dataset field from a dynamic data dictionary which can be expanded as necessary as more datasets are added. These field metadata tags then become the primary vehicle through which scripts are written to subsequently harmonize the data for export and usage in DSM. There are many advantages to this approach. The primary advantage is that datasets are imported “as is”, meaning that data will match the original data source and author format. This increases transparency because there is no prior “re-working” of data before it is added to the database. As scripts are written to harmonize datasets to a defined format using field metadata tags, these scripts will also be available on GitHub to enable any potential user to recreate the eventual harmonized dataset that is utilized for DSM. Finally, because scripting is used for harmonization, output format is flexible. This is critical, because scripts will be developed to harmonize data and output in a format which can be ingested into NASIS.\n\n5.3.1 Data Sharing, Protection and Public Access\nThe GEMS agroinformatics platform developed by the University of Minnesota supports the data interoperability and sharing needs of this project. GEMS adheres to and, via its extensive (and still expanding) data handling toolkit, makes practically possible, FAIR(ER) data sharing principles; findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, ethical—i.e., respects data sensitivities (e.g., partner sourced) or any proprietary (e.g., privately-sourced) data—and reproducible. Non-private data will be made open to the public via GEMS-Open, an open database of functionally interoperable and documented data that adheres to standard and harmonized meta-data protocols. When viewing and analyzing datasets, GEMS requires users to click licenses of each primary data source prior to receiving access to the data. Similarly, all data product derivatives are electronically tagged with links to the product sources in their metadata, ensuring proper credit attributions, as often described by their license agreements. The ASDB will adopt a data policy that accounts for data ownership, allows reuse of data and creation of data derivatives (e.g., pooling of soil data into new larger continental soil applications). We will adopt the Creative Commons Licensing scheme for data sharing and attributions. Importantly, the spectrum of private-public data sharing is accounted for in the ASDB. This is an important aspect because some soil data have inherent restrictions of data usage (e.g., soil projects funded by private companies or corporations, soil data with privacy/confidentiality protection), while other soil projects funded by federal resources are considered public goods without data restrictions. Geographic coordinates are in some cases private data that need to be protected for confidentiality reasons and may be released only for public use in aggregated/masked format."

GEMS also has policies reviewed by MSI’s Research Security and Compliance Analyst. All GEMS staff with access to private data sign an internal non-disclosure agreement designed by UMN’s Office of the General Counsel. All operations within the platform are isolated into encrypted containers where no other users have access (hence no snooping). Data entering or leaving these containers is also encrypted to prevent opportunity for leaks. All identifiable data residing in the platform are legally deemed private and non-public by the State of Minnesota, and hence not FOIAble. Finally, we provide users with various anonymization tools to de-identify their own data sets prior to sharing. These include removal of named identifiers, fuzzing and jittering of geo-coordinates and geospatial aggregation.\n\n5.4.1 Roles and Responsibilities\nPI Jelinski will be responsible ensuring the data management plan is followed by all project participants and will also be responsible for reporting compliance with this data management plan to NRCS. The annual and final reports to NRCS will have an expanded data management plan as an integral component, and will include progress in data sharing (e.g., statistics on shared and accessed data sets, publications, DOIs, outreach materials). The final report will describe the data that was produced during the award period and the components that will be stored and preserved (including the expected duration) after the award ends. The GEMS platform data steward will ensure that the data management plan will be compliant with the Research Terms and Conditions that govern NRCS-funded projects."

The draft can be shared once it goes through public review in 4 months.\nGoal of a DSP project is to get DSP data on as much area as possible, focusing on the most extensive or important soils.\nRecommend 3 plots per condition (similar ecology/land management). Each plot has a main pedon and 2 satellites.\nFor intensive projects, use KSSL methods so data is comparable.\nIntensive projects require KSSL analysis. Intermediate projects use in-house lab. This project would likely be intensive given the UMN lab capacity.\n\n\n\n8.4.2 LA DSP Project Overview\n\nLooked at natural ground cover, artificial ground cover, and traditional lawns. Interested in climate resiliency, carbon storage, and gas fluxes.\nFocused on urban climate and social health. Examined techniques like xeroscaping.\nPartnered with Tree People organization to provide outreach on beneficial landscaping based on DSP data.\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Site Access Challenges and Solutions\n\nAccess can be a challenge. Partnering with local organizations that can help arrange access to sites is recommended.\nCan dig pits once to collect samples. Don’t need long-term access.\nRecommend taking photos, cores, and bulk samples if possible since access is limited.\n\n\n\n8.4.4 Study Design Discussion\n\nMost plots should be spread across the urban area, not concentrated on one site.\nFor urban agriculture focus, residential lawns could be reference state since that is common land use. Hoop houses and in-ground plots would be altered states.\n\nIf including non-urban reference site, look at uncultivated native sites outside urban area.\nDesign depends on goals - compare urban soils only or also compare to non-urban.\nNRCS flexible on study design within urban focus. Recommend consulting urban conservationists like Matt Lundberg.\n\n\n\n8.4.5 Analysis Methods\n\nRequired intensive tier uses KSSL methods. Can send samples to KSSL but may take 1-2 years to get data back.\nOptional intensive tier analyses like POXC could be done in UMN lab.\nInterest in testing additional indicators relevant to urban soils like contaminants.\nIf additional lab costs needed can discuss modifications to support more analyses.\n\n\n\n8.4.6 Related Research Opportunities\n\nIf other non-urban research needs identified later, NRCS may be able to do supplemental sampling through MLRA offices. Would share data to support publications.\nAllows sampling interesting uses like railyards if identified later.\nNeed to avoid overlap with this urban ag focus agreement."

The group discussed balancing NRCS requirements for update surveys with the practical limitations of working in an urban environment. They talked through issues like site access, using non-traditional covariates for digital soil mapping, and the timeline for completing field work over two seasons. Action items included compiling sample density statistics from other urban surveys, continuing permit acquisition, and organizing an initial project kickoff meeting in March 2024. The next meeting will focus on the sampling plan with a smaller work group before bringing together all project partners."

Samples will be archived and analyzed.\nMid-infrared spectroscopy will be used to predict soil properties. Lab data will verify and calibrate predictions.\nRasters, not vectors, will be the main mapping products. Rasters integrate well with the high-resolution LiDAR, land cover, and other metro geospatial data.\nThe NRCS will handle ingesting final raster products into their systems and creating certified SSURGO updates.\n\n\n\n12.4.2 Dynamic Soil Properties (DSP)\n\nA DSP investigation will occur in 2024-2025 at selected urban land use sites.\nThe DSP investigation will be “extensive” level - less intensive than a full DSM project.\nThe focus will likely be on variations across urban land uses, especially urban agriculture.\n2023 will involve planning and selecting sites for the eventual DSP component.\n\n\n\n12.4.3 Mapping Guide\n\nA documented mapping guide will be developed on conducting urban digital soil mapping and surveys.\nIt will build off an existing 2023 Urban Soil Survey Mapping Guide (NRCS Urban Focus Team 2023).\n\n\n\n12.4.4 Outreach\n\nCommunity engagement such as on-site soil screening will be conducted.\nNRCS staff will be invited to outreach events.\n\n\n\n12.4.5 Geophysical Tools\n\nTraining will be provided to NRCS on using field portable X-ray fluorescence for contaminant screening.\nThis will tie into the NRCS’s Site Assessment CEMA 207 protocol."

She will need to clip this to just Minnesota and reproject it to match the coordinate system of the other layers.\nThey will ask Patty if she can generate a layer of just the Soil Survey map units that have urban components. This will require filtering the components table. If not, they can write code to do this filtering but it will take more time.\nThe goal is for Nora to have the TIGER dataset clipped and reprojected to show alongside the developed land use layer for Patty by tomorrow. Then they can discuss generating the relevant soil map units."

    "text": "14.3 Agenda Items\n\n14.3.1 Update on Data Preparation\n\nNora shared her screen in QGIS to show the census urban area clusters data for the US reprojected into UTM zone 15N. She needs to clip this to just Minnesota.\nThe group looked at the generalized land use data. Nora extracted just the “developed” land use categories. This includes residential, commercial, industrial, etc.\nPatty had already clipped the TIGER census boundaries to a 7 or 10 county metro area. There is good alignment between the TIGER developed areas and the generalized land use developed areas.\nThe group discussed using the TIGER boundaries as a starting point to define the project area. They will remove the Stillwater area in Washington County and cut out Anoka County chunks that stretch beyond the core metro.\n\n\n\n14.3.2 Ideas for Defining Project Area\n\nPatty will pull SSURGO soil maps for the 7 county metro area and make a layer showing percent of map units that have “urban” in the component name. This will help identify the core urban areas.\nShe will also pull out Udorthents, as these are commonly used for urban soils but have no data.\nNic suggested also extracting floodplain components, gravel pits, and other “trash can” units that are opportunities for updating.\nNora asked whether well-mapped outer areas should still be updated. Nic said this could add value by updating soil data, but they will focus on the core urban area first.\nThe group looked at historical land use maps from 1945, 1984, and 2020. There has been a lot of development in the southern part of the metro. Nic noted the survey year ranges will influence what gets updated.\n\n\n\n14.3.3 Planning for Kickoff Meeting\n\nPatty relayed that the NRCS office needs a UMN presenter for the April 2 Fargo meeting. Nic will coordinate with Brent to determine who will present.\nPossible kickoff meeting dates are the week of May 6th or the last week of May. Patty will provide a few options from the NRCS side.\n\n\n\n14.3.4 Action Items\n\nNora will trim the urban area shapefile to the core metro area.\nPatty will create SSURGO map unit layers focused on urban, Udorthents, floodplain components, gravel pits, etc.\nNic will follow up on UMN presenter for Fargo kickoff meeting.\nPatty will provide date options for kickoff meeting."

If not available, she can purchase one.\n\n\n\n15.4.2 2. Update on clipping generalized land use data\n\nNora trimmed the generalized land use 2020 data set to the tiger data for the urban area cluster.\nShe encountered errors with geometry while clipping the data set and had to fix it to make a new layer.\nHowever, she is now unable to get the symbology to show correctly, and the attribute table is empty.\nNora is unsure how to clip out specific areas like lakes and islands from the data set.\n\n\n\n15.4.3 3. Discussion on mapping challenges\n\nPatty shared her screen and showed the generalized land use data she had symbolized for 2020.\nPatty explained how she colored different land uses (e.g., agricultural, residential, industrial) for easier visualization.\nPatty also showed a layer she created by clipping the soil survey polygon layer to the 7-county metro area.\nShe joined this layer with NASIS data and created a new column for “percent no data” to identify areas with missing soil horizon data.\nThe duo discussed the challenges of mapping urban areas, floodplains, and undeveloped lands.\nThey identified the need to consult with Nic on the next steps and potentially expand the project boundary.\n\n\n\n15.4.4 4. Potential dates for project kickoff meeting\n\nJoe suggested targeting the last week of May or the first week of June for the project kickoff meeting.\nNic will identify 2-3 days during that period when he can fly in the partners.\nNora will follow up with Nik this week to finalize the dates and get them on everyone’s calendar before the field season starts.\n\n\n\n15.4.5 Other Notes\n\nNora will be out of town on March 13th, 14th and 15th and unavailable for the regular meeting.\nThe meeting for the following week was rescheduled to Tuesday, March 19th at 2:30 PM."
