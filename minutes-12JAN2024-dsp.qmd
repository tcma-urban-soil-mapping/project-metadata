## Agenda

1.  Overview of current DSP guidelines and how to design a study that meets them
2.  Lessons learned from LA DSP project
3.  Site/property access challenges and solutions

## Summary of Discussion

### Overview of DSP Guidelines

-   NRCS is currently updating the DSP guide, expected to be published this year. The draft can be shared once it goes through public review in 4 months.
-   Goal of a DSP project is to get DSP data on as much area as possible, focusing on the most extensive or important soils.
-   Recommend 3 plots per condition (similar ecology/land management). Each plot has a main pedon and 2 satellites.
-   For intensive projects, use KSSL methods so data is comparable.
-   Intensive projects require KSSL analysis. Intermediate projects use in-house lab. This project would likely be intensive given the UMN lab capacity.

### LA DSP Project Overview

-   Looked at natural ground cover, artificial ground cover, and traditional lawns. Interested in climate resiliency, carbon storage, and gas fluxes.
-   Focused on urban climate and social health. Examined techniques like xeroscaping.
-   Partnered with Tree People organization to provide outreach on beneficial landscaping based on DSP data.

### Site Access Challenges and Solutions

-   Access can be a challenge. Partnering with local organizations that can help arrange access to sites is recommended.
-   Can dig pits once to collect samples. Don't need long-term access.
-   Recommend taking photos, cores, and bulk samples if possible since access is limited.

### Study Design Discussion

-   Most plots should be spread across the urban area, not concentrated on one site.
-   For urban agriculture focus, residential lawns could be reference state since that is common land use. Hoop houses and in-ground plots would be altered states.\
-   If including non-urban reference site, look at uncultivated native sites outside urban area.
-   Design depends on goals - compare urban soils only or also compare to non-urban.
-   NRCS flexible on study design within urban focus. Recommend consulting urban conservationists like Matt Lundberg.

### Analysis Methods

-   Required intensive tier uses KSSL methods. Can send samples to KSSL but may take 1-2 years to get data back.
-   Optional intensive tier analyses like POXC could be done in UMN lab.
-   Interest in testing additional indicators relevant to urban soils like contaminants.
-   If additional lab costs needed can discuss modifications to support more analyses.

### Related Research Opportunities

-   If other non-urban research needs identified later, NRCS may be able to do supplemental sampling through MLRA offices. Would share data to support publications.
-   Allows sampling interesting uses like railyards if identified later.
-   Need to avoid overlap with this urban ag focus agreement.

## Action Items

-   UMN team will continue planning using DSP guidelines and input from NRCS
-   NRCS to share draft DSP guide when ready for public review
-   Discuss ideas for related non-urban research with NRCS
-   Send samples to KSSL or UMN lab depending on timeline needs and funding

## Next Steps

-   UMN to share meeting minutes and recordings
-   Additional DSP planning check-ins as site selection progresses
