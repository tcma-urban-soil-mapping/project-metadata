## Agenda

1. Overview of current DSP guidelines and how to design a study that meets them
2. Lessons learned from LA DSP project
3. Site/property access challenges and solutions

## Summary of Discussion

### Overview of DSP Guidelines

- NRCS is currently updating the DSP guide, expected to be published this year. The draft can be shared once it goes through public review in 4 months.
- Goal of a DSP project is to get DSP data on as much area as possible, focusing on the most extensive or important soils. 
- Recommend 3 plots per condition (similar ecology/land management). Each plot has a main pedon and 2 satellites.
- For intensive projects, use KSCL methods so data is comparable.
- Intensive projects require KSCL analysis. Intermediate projects use in-house lab. This project would likely be intensive given the UMN lab capacity.

### LA DSP Project Overview
- Looked at natural ground cover, artificial ground cover, and traditional lawns. Interested in climate resiliency, carbon storage, and gas fluxes.
- Focused on urban climate and social health. Examined techniques like xeroscaping.
- Partnered with Tree People organization to provide outreach on beneficial landscaping based on DSP data.

### Site Access Challenges and Solutions
- Access can be a challenge. Partnering with local organizations that can help arrange access to sites is recommended.
- Can dig pits once to collect samples. Don't need long-term access.
- Recommend taking photos, cores, and bulk samples if possible since access is limited.

### Study Design Discussion
- Most plots should be spread across the urban area, not concentrated on one site.
- For urban agriculture focus, residential lawns could be reference state since that is common land use. Hoop houses and in-ground plots would be altered states.  
- If including non-urban reference site, look at uncultivated native sites outside urban area.
- Design depends on goals - compare urban soils only or also compare to non-urban.
- NRCS flexible on study design within urban focus. Recommend consulting urban conservationists like Matt Lundberg.

### Analysis Methods
- Required intensive tier uses KSSL methods. Can send samples to KSSL but may take 1-2 years to get data back.
- Optional intensive tier analyses like POXC could be done in UMN lab. 
- Interest in testing additional indicators relevant to urban soils like contaminants.
- If additional lab costs needed can discuss modifications to support more analyses.

### Related Research Opportunities
- If other non-urban research needs identified later, NRCS may be able to do supplemental sampling through MLRA offices. Would share data to support publications.
- Allows sampling interesting uses like railyards if identified later.
- Need to avoid overlap with this urban ag focus agreement.

## Action Items
- UMN team will continue planning using DSP guidelines and input from NRCS
- NRCS to share draft DSP guide when ready for public review
- Discuss ideas for related non-urban research with NRCS
- Send samples to KSCL or UMN lab depending on timeline needs and funding

## Next Steps
- UMN to share meeting minutes and recordings
- Additional DSP planning check-ins as site selection progresses
